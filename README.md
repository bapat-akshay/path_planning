Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm using C++

This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's and A* algorithms.
Input is the map width and map height, start node coordinates, goal node coordinates, and two vector lists containing X and Y coordinates of obstacles.
The output, shown via cout, is a sequence of nodes showing the obstacle-free path (if valid) from the start to the goal nodes.
To run, compile "dijkstra.cpp" or "astar.cpp" and run the executable.
